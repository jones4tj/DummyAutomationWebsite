# DummyAutomationWebsite
This is a small selenium project to show hands-on experience to potential employer.
I am testing a dummy automation website ("https://saucedemo.com/") using Selenium, Cucumber, TestNG, Log4j, Extent Reports, and Maven.

If you want to see the results of the tests, simply open reports/index.html for extent reports
or test-output/index.html for the testrunner default reporting.

Clone to IntelliJ:
-Clone the project to IntelliJ
-right-click pom.xml and select "Add as Maven Project"
-Open maven tool window and press "Reload all maven projects" to install the dependencies

Clone to Eclipse:
-Clone the project to Eclipse

I am constantly learning and excited to grow when it comes to writing clean code.
