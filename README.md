# DummyAutomationWebsite
This is a small selenium project to show hands-on experience to potential employer.
I am testing a dummy automation website ("https://saucedemo.com/") using Selenium, Cucumber, TestNG, Log4j, Extent Reports, and Maven.
I created an ILogger interface to show foresight of making it easy to implement other loggers in the future.
As this is a dummy automation website, there are some tests that are supposed to fail.

If you want to see the results of the tests, simply open index.html from extent reports.
I wrote clean code for a stranger to the project to easily read.

I am constantly learning and excited to grow when it comes to writing clean code.
