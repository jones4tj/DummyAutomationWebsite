# DummyAutomationWebsite
This is a small selenium project to show hands-on experience to potential employer.
I am testing a dummy automation website ("https://saucedemo.com/") using Selenium, Cucumber, TestNG, Log4j, Extent Reports, and Maven.

If you want to see the results of the tests, simply open reports/index.html for extent reports
or test-output/index.html for the testrunner default reporting.

Clone to IntelliJ:<br>
Clone the project to IntelliJ<br>
right-click pom.xml and select "Add as Maven Project"<br>
Open maven tool window and press "Reload all maven projects" to install the dependencies<br>
Make sure @CucumberOptions(features="DummyAutomationWebsite/src/test/java/DummyAutomationWebsite/cucumber",...)<br>
Run test/java/DummyAutomationWebsite/cucumber/TestRunner as TestNG Test<br>

Clone to Eclipse:<br>
Clone the project to Eclipse by importing from git and selecting clone uri<br>
Make sure @CucumberOptions(features="src/test/java/DummyAutomationWebsite/cucumber",...)<br>
Install TestNG plugin from Eclipse Marketplace to run test/java/DummyAutomationWebsite/cucumber/TestRunner as TestNG Test<br>

I am constantly learning and excited to grow when it comes to writing clean code.
